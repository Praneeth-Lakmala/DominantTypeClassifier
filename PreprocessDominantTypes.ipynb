In November 1914 the Royal Navy suffered a serious defeat at the Battle of Coronel. In response Sturdee was to the South Atlantic to seek out the German squadron, commanded by Graf Maximilian von Spee, which had caused the damage at Coronel. On 8 December 1914, while coaling at Stanley, Sturdee encountered von Spee and the subsequent action became known as the Battle of the Falkland Islands. Von Spee, finding that he was engaged with a superior force, was forced to flee. In the course of the pursuit Sturdee's forces sank almost the entire German squadron. Only one light cruiser escaped but she was hunted down in March 1915.\", 'mso/military.person']\n",

He was one of the pioneers in the Norwegian resistance movement, and was arrested by the Gestapo in 1941. He escaped to England for training and went back as a saboteur for the Norwegian Independent Company 1, better known as Lingekompaniet. He became a specialist in ship sabotage and, by using Limpet mine, sank ships that were important to the German Kriegsmarine, including the SS Monte Rosa in 1944 and the SS Donau on 16 January 1945.

He fought during the Norwegian campaign, whereupon he decided to return to Oslo and work underground against the occupiers, both organising a resistance movement, illegal public propaganda and the manufacture of weaponry. He and his comrades nearly managed to assassinate Himmler and Goebbels when they visited Oslo.#R##N##R##N#His work was effective and he soon became a wanted man by the Gestapo.

He made numerous hazardous trips back and forth across the border to Sweden, where he was able to get a respite from the constant mental and physical pressures of being undercover.

Svoger til Sjur Lindebrække (1909–98).#R##N##R##N#Max Manus var en av de mest kjente motstandsmennene under den annen verdenskrig. Han utførte en rekke dristige sabotasjeaksjoner i Norge og var fra 1944 med i “Oslogjengen”.#R##N##R##N#Max Manus ble født i Bergen, moren var dansk. Bare 13 år gammel ble han tatt med til en onkel på Cuba, og de følgende år var han messegutt, anleggsarbeider i Sør-Amerika og gjennomførte eventyrlige vandringer over Andesfjellene til Argentina, for etter mange viderverdigheter å returnere til Norge. Før det tyske angrepet på Norge 1940 deltok Manus som frivillig soldat i vinterkrigen i Finland etter det sovjetiske overfallet. Han nådde imidlertid hjem tidsnok til å delta i krigen i Norge i 1940, nærmere bestemt ved Kongsvinger. Her sloss han sammen med andre finlandsfrivillige mot en tysk bataljon.#R##N##R##N#Manus kom inn i organisert motstandsarbeid allerede fra høsten 1940. Han var med på å gi ut den illegale avisen “Vi vil oss et land”, men drev også med forberedelser til militær motstand. 16. januar 1941 ble han overrasket i sin leilighet i Vidars gate i Oslo av seks personer fra Statspolitiet, men klarte å kaste seg ut gjennom et vindu. Med brukket rygg ble han sendt til Ullevål sykehus, men etter en knapp måned firte han seg ut av et vindu og ble hjulpet videre i sikkerhet.#R##N##R##N#Etter en 7-måneders tur via Stockholm og halve jorden rundt, kom Manus seg til Storbritannia. 17. desember samme år ble han tatt opp i Nor.I.C.1 (Kompani Linge). Hans spesialitet ble skipssabotasje. 12. mars 1943 kom han tilbake til Norge sammen med Gregers Gram for å gjennomføre operasjon “Mardonius”: skipssabotasje med magnetiske sprengladninger festet til skip i Oslo havneområde. Natt til 27. april klarte han sammen med to andre å senke Ortelsburg (3800 tonn), gi Tugela (5800 tonn) slagside samt senke en oljelekter.#R##N##R##N#Senere deltok Manus i operasjon “Bundle” fra oktober 1943 til april 1944, også dette skipssabotasje. Han hadde kontakt både med Gunnar Sønsteby(“Nr. 24”) og til Sentralledelsen i Milorg. Etter to mislykkede sabotasjeforsøk reiste Manus tilbake til Stockholm.#R##N##R##N#Fra våren 1944 ble han en del av “Oslogjengen”, ledet av Sønsteby. Dette var Sentralledelsens sabotasjegjeng, og Manus deltok i flere aksjoner i det siste krigsåret. Samtidig arbeidet han sammen med Gram med å spre propaganda innad i tyskernes rekker. Juni 1944 forsøkte han, også da sammen med Gram, å senke troppetransportskipet Monte Rosa, men skipet ble bare skadet. Manus klarte imidlertid i januar 1945 sammen med Roy Nielsen å senke Donau, også det et troppetransportskip. Dette skipet hadde 1942 fraktet arresterte norske jøder til Tyskland.#R##N##R##N#I frigjøringsdagene 1945 fikk “Oslogjengen” ansvaret for sikkerheten til kronprins Olav da han ankom til Oslo 13. mai. Kronprinsen kjørte gjennom byen i åpen bil med Manus som livvakt plassert i forsetet med sin stengun parat. Det samme skjedde da kong Haakon 7 kom hjem fra Storbritannia 7. juni: Manus ble plassert som livvakt i forsetet på kongens bil.#R##N##R##N#Like etter krigen skrev Manus bøkene Det vil helst gå godt og Det blir alvor om opplevelsene under krigen. De ble solgt i over 300 000 eksemplarer, og bøkene gav Manus en nærmest legendarisk posisjon som motstandsmann. Med pengene fra boksalget bygde han opp kontormaskinfirmaet Max Manus A/S.#R##N##R##N#Manus ble tildelt de høyeste norske, britiske og amerikanske militære dekorasjoner. Som en av svært få fikk han bl.a. Krigskorset med to sverd. Han gjorde i mange år tjeneste i Heimevernet, bl.a. som områdesjef i Asker, og var en periode formann i Oslo Forsvarsforening.

Etter to mislykkede sabotasjeforsøk reiste Manus tilbake til Stockholm.#R##N##R##N#Fra våren 1944 ble han en del av “Oslogjengen”, ledet av Sønsteby. Dette var Sentralledelsens sabotasjegjeng, og Manus deltok i flere aksjoner i det siste krigsåret. Samtidig arbeidet han sammen med Gram med å spre propaganda innad i tyskernes rekker. Juni 1944 forsøkte han, også da sammen med Gram, å senke troppetransportskipet Monte Rosa, men skipet ble bare skadet. Manus klarte imidlertid i januar 1945 sammen med Roy Nielsen å senke Donau, også det et troppetransportskip. Dette skipet hadde 1942 fraktet arresterte norske jøder til Tyskland.#R##N##R##N#I frigjøringsdagene 1945 fikk “Oslogjengen” ansvaret for sikkerheten til kronprins Olav da han ankom til Oslo 13. mai. Kronprinsen kjørte gjennom byen i åpen bil med Manus som livvakt plassert i forsetet med sin stengun parat. Det samme skjedde da kong Haakon 7 kom hjem fra Storbritannia 7. juni: Manus ble plassert som livvakt i forsetet på kongens bil.#R##N##R##N#Like etter krigen skrev Manus bøkene Det vil helst gå godt og Det blir alvor om opplevelsene under krigen. De ble solgt i over 300 000 eksemplarer, og bøkene gav Manus en nærmest legendarisk posisjon som motstandsmann. Med pengene fra boksalget bygde han opp kontormaskinfirmaet Max Manus A/S.#R##N##R##N#Manus ble tildelt de høyeste norske, britiske og amerikanske militære dekorasjoner. Som en av svært få fikk han bl.a. Krigskorset med to sverd. Han gjorde i mange år tjeneste i Heimevernet, bl.a. som områdesjef i Asker, og var en periode formann i Oslo Forsvarsforening. Han giftet seg med Ida Lindebrække, som under krigen arbeidet hos den britiske konsulen i Stockholm, med særlig ansvar for Linge-karene. De siste årene av hans liv bodde ekteparet mest på Kanariøyene.#R##N#Verker#R##N#Det vil helst gå godt, 1945#R##N#Det blir alvor, 1946#R##N#Mitt liv (sm.m. B.
